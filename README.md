Learn the concept of priority-driven scheduling and how to modify the Linux kernel.

Problem
Process scheduling is an essential part of an operating system supporting multiprogramming. There are various scheduling algorithms for different situations. However, many of them are based on the same concept: priority-driven scheduling. For priority-driven scheduling, it is important to assign an appropriate priority level to each process. The assignment depends on the desired scheduling policy. For example, a round-robin scheduler can be implemented by assigning the same priority level to all the processes. In this project, we would like to study the relation between priority assignment and scheduling policies.
